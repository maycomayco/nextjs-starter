# Starter Template for Next.js 🚀

This is a starter template for Next.js version 15. It includes pre-configured tools to optimize the start of a new application and features some opinionated code.

## Main Features ✨

- All default options provided by Next.js.
- Custom configurations for IDEs (VSCode or Cursor).
- Custom configurations for ESLint and Prettier.
- Pre-configured "not-found" page.
- Naming Conventions: We rely on `kebab-case` for naming files and directories. This is enforced using the `check-file` ESLint plugin, which includes rules for filename and folder naming conventions.

## Installation 🛠️

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory

## ⚠️ Work in Progress

Environment variable detection during the build process using the `jiti` library is currently a work in progress. The developer has not yet found a solution compatible with Next.js 15. Stay tuned for future updates to address this issue.

**Note:** Feel free to customize the included configurations to better fit your project. We hope this starter template saves you time and helps you build amazing applications with Next.js! 🚀
